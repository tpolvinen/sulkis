## Badminton Cup Scorekeeping

Very basic Spring MVC, I18n, bean validation & Spring Security

As a user one can add matches to cup/tournament (date will be server's current date).
As an admin one can add players to cup/tournament and empty the database altogether.
Without login everyone can view number of wins per player on front page.

IRL all data of all matches, players and tournament should be visible on front page. Also user should be able to CRUD the data they have entered themselves.
